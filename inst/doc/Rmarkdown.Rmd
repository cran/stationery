\begin{abstract} This discusses the basics of `R markdown` that are
important for authors who want to prepare documents that go beyond the
bare rudiments of markdown. In our Center, we expect all authors who
prepare documents with `R markdown` should understand the potential
and limitations of markdown when they use it.
\end{abstract}

# Introduction: Terminology

Markdown (John Gruber, https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
is a different way to write documents that include computer code. It
started as a replacement for HTML code used in Websites. Because HTML
and LaTeX `markup` was tedious and unreadable, he proposed instead a
`markdown` language. The intention was to have documents that are
understandable for non-technical readers, but capable of presentation
as Web pages or PDF document. The aspirations of the markdown
community are now considerably broader. There are many competing
dialects of the markup language.  There are efforts to generalize the
back end format to Open Document, Microsoft Word, and other
formats.

`R markdown` is a particular kind of markdown document. Authors should
be cautious about following formatting advice for other types of
markdown when working on `R markdown`. The distinguishing feature of
`R markdown` is that it cooperates with R.  Like \LaTeX\ with Sweave,
code chunks can be included.  When the document is compiled, the code
is executed in R and results are tabulated into the output ("knitting"
the chunks).  The chunk conversion process creates an intermediate
file format, usually a `pandoc` markdown file, often with a suffix
like `.utf8.md`.  That markdown document is then converted to the
eventual back end format through one or more additional transitions.

It is important to remember that `R markdown` is not the same as
"markdown," for which there are many different dialects.  The markdown
standard to which `R markdown` is closest is `pandoc` markdown because
the program `pandoc` is widely used to convert the `.utf8.md` file
into HTML or PDF. However, that is not necessarily the case. On many
Web servers, a program called Jekyl (https://jekyllrb.com/) is used to
convert markdown files to static HTML pages for quick rendering.

The `R` packages `knitr` and `rmarkdown` provide functions required to
convert code chunks and create the intermediate markdown document. The
free-standing program `pandoc` plays the pivotal role in most personal
computer applications. It converts markdown files to HTML or `LaTeX`.

In my experience, there are several document features that can be
produced with `R markdown`, but just about as many `LaTeX` features
are no available via pure markdown. That puts us in a "gray area," 
where we are either forced to change our writing style or code 
the document differently. This is discussed in the section \ref{sec:mdplus}.

# Document-wide options

`R markdown` is prepared in a text document that has two parts. The
first part, which can be referred to as the header or preamble,
includes "metadata". The metadata is information about the document,
the authors, and how it must be compiled.

The header is written in the YAML format (YAML
originally meant *Yet Another Markup Language*, now stands for *YAML
Ain't Markup Language*; see [The Official YAML Web
Site](http://yaml.org)).

The header for the document you are reading now in PDF is:

## Observations about YAML

### Parameter and values (`key:value` pairs) are separated by `:`.

   One must use the colon, not (**NOT!**) the equal sign). 
   
   Logical values are specified by lowercase, unquoted `true`,
   `false`, or `null`. If a value (say, a document title) includes a
   colon, quotation marks should be used.
   
### Finding the keys keys

Authors will need to acquire experience about valid keys for their
intended output format. The `key: value` pairs in the header are
meaningful if the document processing software takes them into
account. Otherwise, they are just decorations that on which authors
waste their time. To test that idea, authors might insert this in the
header of the current document
     
    christmaslist: "pandora account", "gold watch"
   
and recompile. There are no errors or warnings about unrecognized key
values.

Flush-left `key` values are either top-level parameters (`title`,
`date`, `fontsize`) or initiators of metadata blocks.    The `header-includes` section is relevant only to
the \LaTeX\ stage of document preparation. 

The structure of the `author` and `addr` blocks is unique to the
template that governs this document (the template is specified in the
output block). With different templates, the format of the `key:value`
author information will differ.

### The format is of the YAML header is **VERY** sensitive. 

A. The header begins with three dashes, in column 1:
   
   `---`

   and ends with three dashes, in column 1
   
   `---`
    
B. Subsections are represented by indentation. The leading users
	of `R markdown` prefer indentation using 2 spaces, not 4 as in base
	R code.  We follow that in this document.

C. Errors in formatting are fatal.  Using tabs to indent YAML code
   leads to a ***fatal error***.  Thankfully, the error messages point
   directly at the offending line in the header. Inserting a tab
   before `highlight: haddock` results in this error:
	
   ```
   Error in yaml::yaml.load(string, ...) :
     Scanner error: while scanning a plain scalar at line 10, column 19 
   found a tab character that violate intendation(sic) at line 11, column 1
   Calls: rmd2pdf ... parse_yaml_front_matter -> yaml_load_utf8 -> <Anonymous>
   Execution halted
   ```  

   
### The output stanza specifies the back end format

In the stationery package, we are focused primarily on HTML and PDF
because, at the current time, these formats are the most
dependable.

The output specification in this document means that the function
`pdf_document` in the `markdown` package will be used to create an
output object.  The `.Rmd` file is converted to pandoc markdown,
`.utf8.md`, then into \LaTeX, then PDF.
   
It is tricky for authors to figure out which keys will work, and how
their values will be specified. Lamentably, it may be necessary to
read the source code of an R package like `rmarkdown` to understand
all of the details. However, usually, there is some relief in the fact
that there is one example working document to exemplify the settings
for a particular back end and authors can adjust and modify those
values.  The `key:value` pairs may may a difference at several
stages in the compilation process. 

Users should be aware that a moderately complex `R markdown` document
will usually be a success only if it is built with a particular output
format in mind. Many document components are created with PDF **or**
HTML output in mind and they are not generally compatible with
both. The number of "cross-compiling" gotchas will probably decline
with time, but currently there are many difficulties awaiting someone
who writes a document intended for HTML and later wants to generate
PDF from the same markdown document.
    
It is also worth mentioning that the `RStudio` pulldown button Knit
can be misleading. It creates the impression that one can choose
freely between "Knit to PDF" or "Knit to HTML," but that will usually
fail. Be warned also that Rstudio will revise the content of the
document header, possibly corrupting its formatting.
          
 
    
# `render` equals `knitr` + `pandoc`

The process for rendering documents is discussed in the `stationery`
vignette. The key point is that the code chunks must be digested by
`R` and replaced with valid input and output text.  After that, the 
document is converted by a sequence of transitions, `.Rmd` to `.utf8.md`
to `.tex` to `.pdf`.

The conversion of the `.Rmd` file into `pandoc` markdown is known as
"knitting". It is the same functionality that is performed by
"sweaving" an R noweb `.Rnw` \LaTeX\ document. The `knitr` package for
R plays a vital role because it has the procedures that make this an
`R markdown` document, rather than just a markdown document with code
examples pasted in.

It is a little more difficult to understand the role of the
`rmarkdown` package in the document transition process. Perhaps the
reader will find some ancient history to be helpful. 

In the olden days, say 2014, we could write R markdown documents that
did not require the `rmarkdown` package.  The workflow was simple.

### 1. Create a bare minimum YAML header {-}

I once wrote a slide show called "Rmd on Rmd" and called the file
`rmdonrmd.Rmd`. There was almost no YAML at all.

```
---
title: "Rmd on Rmd"
author: "Paul E. Johnson"
---
```

That document included R code chunks. It had everything I needed to do
at the time. Except I did not understand the problem that the final
format might be customized by an intricate array of settings. The
importance of those settings will become apparent if we continue the story.

### 2. Render the document in 2 steps

To convert my cave-person markdown document to HTML, I would use 2
steps in the command line.  First, handle the chunks with `knitr`.
   
```{}
R CMD knit rmdonrmd.Rmd
```

That created a new file, `rmdonrmd.md`.

I wanted this to turn into a presentation document in a Web format,
and somehow I found out that if you told pandoc that your "to" format
was `S5`, then a slidy presentation would be created. So I ran:

```
$ pandoc rmdonrmd.md -t S5 -o rmdonrmd.html
```
   
The `-o` parameter indicates we want an output file `rmdonrmd.html`.

At that time, I did not understand very well the problem that a
document that uses the special features of one backend will generally
be incompatible with other formats.  As long as the document does not
use any special features, however, it can be converted to a slideshow
in PDF format.  This (in 2014, at least) would generate that PDF:

```
$ pandoc rmdonrmd.md -t beamer -V theme:Warsaw -o rmdonrmd.pdf
```

The major danger, then and now, is that an incomplete the output file
might be created. Some document elements that we are counting on fail
to appear. Incorrect \LaTeX\ markup results in "blank spots" in Web
output, for example.

### What's wrong with the old way?

The people that are extremely deep in the details of document
preparation know that there are ***many*** details that authors might
adjust. Do you want a table of contents? If yes, how many headings do
you want to include? Do you want code listings to have colored
backgrounds? How do you want keywords to be highlighted? Do you want
figures to float freely in the document? If so, what algorithm is to
be used. 

All of these features are in play and most of us--authors--don't want
to know all of the details about how the `R markdown` document is
turned into the eventual result.  The authors of the `rmarkdown`
document are the ones who know the ins-and-outs and they created an elaborate
system that reads the `keys` in the markdown document and then
reformats it and, most importantly, calls `pandoc` with an immense
list of command line options.

If I compile an `R markdown` document today, and I allow verbose
output of the steps used to build the document, I see, at the very
end, the `pandoc` function call. 

```
/usr/bin/pandoc +RTS -K512m -RTS rmdonrmd.utf8.md --to slidy 
--from markdown+autolink_bare_uris+ascii_identifiers+tex_math_single_backslash 
--output rmdonrmd.html --smart --email-obfuscation none --self-contained 
--template /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rmarkdown/rmd/slidy/default.html 
--include-in-header /tmp/RtmpAa6kai/rmarkdown-str2de413c62f71.html 
--mathjax --variable 'mathjax-url:https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML' 
--highlight-style pygments

Output created: rmdonrmd.html
```
    
This `pandoc` call converts a pandoc markdown file, `rmdonrmd.uft8.md`
(which was  created from rmdonrmd.Rmd) into HTML. 

In a nutshell, we need the `rmarkdown` package because it can deal
with the immense complexity of `pandoc`.  The `rmarkdown` package is
the glue. It creates output format objects that specify a large family
of sensible settings that are sent to `pandoc`. Because there were
some complications in the creation of documents with the custom
templates in the `stationery` package, I had to study the code in
`rmarkdown` for quite a while. Every time I came away with just one
thought. It would have taken me several years to piece together all of
those details.


# Preparing an R Markdown Document
	
## Use a text editor

An `R markdown` file is suffixed ".Rmd". It is a "raw text"
file. Don't edit it with MS Word.  Instead, use a programmers file
editor, such as `Emacs`, `Notepad++`, or an integrated development
environment, such as `RStudio`, to edit the file.

## Be considerate of the .Rmd document's reader

Remember that the markdown philosophy is that a document should look
reasonably nice, even before it is compiled.  That means authors
should take care that their document has reasonably "shaped"
paragraphs. Lines should generally be 80 characters or less.



## Document body has markdown, plus $\ldots$ \label{sec:mdplus}

The body of the `R markdown` document can include both "markdown" syntax,
which we hope is compatible with either PDF or HTML backends, as well
as a selection of backend-specific code input. In a document with an
HTML backend, authors can write "raw" HTML when they can't find
R markdown syntax that works.

In our experience, it is also *mostly* workable to include \LaTeX\
code in `R markdown` documents. Recall that documents in `R markdown`
are converted from `Rmd` to `md` by the knitting process, and then
into \LaTeX\ by `pandoc`, and then into PDF by a \LaTeX\ compiler
(`pdflatex`, `xetex` or similar). As a result, one can insert quite a
bit of \LaTeX\ code and it will often be successfully post-processed
in the last stage of document compilation.

We have found that some \LaTeX\ code does not work well, however, so
it is not possible at the current time to say "everything
works". However, many things do work.

As in \LaTeX\ itself, when an author wants to add features, it is
generally necessary to add `\usepackage{}` statements in the \LaTeX\
document preamble.  We use a \LaTeX\ template for this document; it
includes many packages. Packages that are not included in the template
can be tucked into the YAML preamble:

```
header-includes:
-  \usepackage{amsmath}
```

We did not realize that `amsmath` was necessary until an author typed in 
a valid formula that ended up with missing characters in the output file.


# Basic R Markdown

These are the most frequently used markdown idioms that work well in
both HTML and PDF backends. These things work well in either backend
because they are understood to `pandoc`, which has the job to convert
the `markdown` document into either \LaTeX\ or HTML.

1. Character styling. 
    *  *Italics* result from asterisks (`*italics*`)
    *  **bold face** results from two asterisks (`**boldface**`).
    *  Inline `computer code` should be a typewriter fixed width font produced by
    using two "backticks" ($^\backprime \textrm{computer code} ^\backprime$) 
1. Section headers. 
    *  `#` is level 1 header
    *  `##` is level 2 subheading
    *  levels below are used differently in HTML and PDF.  The ability of
   html documents to include specialized subsections is one of the
   advantages of that backend. In R markdown,6 levels
   of headings are allowed.
   
   There is a problem to be aware of. A section header may not have a linebreak in it. 

   An error so simple as writing a section title that has a line wrap
   will cause poor quality output.
   
1. Paragraph styling
    * Paragraphs are created by blank lines
    * Single-spaced line: Two blank spaces at end of line signify a new
    line without creating new paragraph (blank line) below.
    * Block quotes: Indented material like this:

    > Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

    begins with a $>$ character in column 1, followed by a space:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    The second and following lines should be entered without blank lines.

    * code listings that are not R chunks, such as

    ```
    int x = 3
    ```
    are requested by three ticks before and after

    \begin{lstlisting}
    `r ''```` 
    int x = 3 
    `r ''````
    \end{lstlisting}

4. Lists. 
    *  Numbered lists can be created by putting a number in column 1
       of a new line, followed by a period.
    *  Unnumbered (Bullet) lists can be created by putting an asterix
       in column 1 of a new line, followed by a space.
    *  Lists can be nested by typing four blank spaces for each level
       of nesting.
        + A continuation of the existing list's style can be obtained by inserting a plus sign.
    * It is possible to insert paragraphs within lists. 
       These should be indented 3 spaces.

1. Hyperlinks, such as [CRMDA](https://crmda.ku.edu), for which the
   markdown is `[CRMDA](https://crmda.ku.edu)`.
5. Citations. Need to know how to use natbib citations in a markdown
   document ?? ???
	
This *basic markdown* is compatible with either HTML or PDF
output. While I am writing in a document intended for PDF, I can use
\LaTeX\ code `\emph{italicize}` to \emph{italicize}, as you can see,
but I can also use markdown syntax `*italicize*` to *italicize*. If I
were intending this document for HTML, I could insert
`<i>italicize</i>` to reach the same result. 

Where feasible, we should use the generic markdown syntax rather than
backend-specific markup, because this keeps open the door that we
might want to change the backend from PDF to HTML at some point. Of
course, *the key assumption is that the backend-neutral methods
actually work* to get the job done, and that is simply untrue in my
experience. Nevertheless, this is a valuable aspiration and it is a
focal point of current software development.
	

## Math in Markdown documents

There's a fairly broad range of mathematical markup that will work in
R markdown documents intended for PDF and HTML. So far as we can tell,
documents intended for PDF (which can add \LaTeX\ packages) can
exploit all of the mathematical features, while HTML documents do not
have that same advantage. There are other weaknesses in the math
tool chain for HTML documents, to which we shall return.

Here are the highlights.

1. In-line math markup is dollar-sign bracketed, just as in \LaTeX
   itself. We write `$f_{ij} x_{i} \times y_{j}^2$` for
   $f_{ij} x_{i} \times y_{j}^2$. Using the usual \LaTeX\ format, we
   can write the Greek letters, binary relations, and other important
   symbols. Behold:

\[
   \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \Gamma, \chi, \approx, \ne, \geq, \leq, \pm,
   \sim, \rightarrow, \pi, \textrm{and} \infty.
\]

2. Displayed equations--equations that are centered or otherwise set
apart from the text--can be bracketed by `\[` and `\]`. In \LaTeX,
it is not longer recommended to use the double-dollar sign notation
for displayed equations.
 
Compare the inline mode, $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$
with the display equation:

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\]

that results from

```
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\]
```

After some testing, it appears that in order to have equations with
numbers (via labels, allowing cross references), the best avenue is to
change the display markup to use `amsmath` equations. In the
following, we use the \LaTeX\ ```\begin{equation}```, which comes from
the \LaTeX\ package *amsmath*.

```
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
```

This equation is numbered, because the label macro is included within
the equation:

\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}

Because we labeled the equation, we can now use cross references. For
example, as the reader can see in equation (\ref{eq:mean}), the
arithmetic mean is a very lovely formula. If we insert equations
before or after that one, they will be renumbered automatically and
cross references will be adjusted.

Another benefit of introducing the amsmath support is that arrays
can be demonstrated.

\begin{equation}
A_{m,n} = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
g & h & i\\
\end{array}\right)
\label{eq:amatrix}
\end{equation}

Given the fact that the `equation` environment provides all of the
needed features, it seems obvious that authors should prefer to use
it, rather than the simpler `\[` markup.

This is not the right place for a comprehensive guide to \LaTeX.
Users will need to install a \LaTeX\ distribution and then a
user-friendly editor that will help create equation markup.  Many
users in the CRMDA lab use LyX, which offers a "View source" feature
to inspect \LaTeX\ coding for equations.	

## Syntax and code chunks

Code chunks are discussed in a separate vignette that is available
with the `stationery` package, "Code Chunks".  Code chunks are allowed in
`R markdown` documents intended for either HTML or PDF.

In `R markdown` documents intended for HTML output, `knitr` is the only
chunk-processing technology that is available.  In `R markdown`
documents, the outer boundaries of a chunk are demarcated by three
back ticks, along with squiggly braces and the letter "r", which
designates the language being processed (`knitr` can handle several
languages).

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r}
lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

In contrast, a chunk in a `noweb`/\LaTeX\ document would look like
this:

```
<<>>=
lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
@
```

Options which control chunk management are quite elaborate in `knitr`,
but most authors will find that there are 5 (or so) options that they use
frequently and the others can be discovered in the documentation
when emergencies arise:

1. eval
1. echo
1. include
1. results

These control if the chunk is calculated, displayed, and included in
the output. 

`knitr` has fine grained settings for sizing, saving, and placing
figures. These are discussed in our vignette, "Code Chunks". We expect
that all authors will not have too much difficulty creating chunks
that

1. are not evaluated, but are displayed "beautifully" to the reader.
2. are not displayed, but are evaluated, and the results may (or may
   not) be displayed for the reader.
3. create graphics, which are automatically included in the document.
4. create graphics (or other files) that are not automatically
   included in the document. Graphics are saved in image files that
   can be inserted at a different part in the document

## Presentable tables

In a report document, it would be unusual to display a large chunk of
R code or output. Instead, reports typically include stylized tables,
graphs, and equations. 

Unfortunately, this is a point at which the backend-neutral document
processing strategies break down. Markdown allows some elementary
tables, but these are unsuitable for statistical tables. Instead, one needs
to create backend-specific tables in order to have something
presentable. 


The very nice table-making routines for R were originally developed
for PDF/\LaTeX\, and alternative backends like HTML were added later.
At the current time, regression tables can be generated in either
\LaTeX\ or HTML by the R package `texreg`, `xtable`, `rockchalk`, and
many others.


### Warnings aside, here are 2 table-making recipes

I have used two approaches to include tables in documents. 

1. The "automatic" method.  Write a code chunk that creates an output table
   that is good enough to go into the report without revision and
   allow the document to use it. The chunk option `results="asis"` is 
   used to signal that the result of the chunk is valid markup that is
   to go directly into the backend document.
1. The "slow lane" method. Write a chunk that creates a table in a
   file on disk. Then one can review and edit the file, and include it
   in the document manually.

In "guides" and less formal documents, I often use the automatic
method (beauty of presentation is not the primary emphasis). In
reports to clients, I often need to use the second method because
tables almost never come out in a perfectly presentable format.

Because I wrote the `outreg` function in the rockchalk a long time
ago, it still holds a special place in my heart. I will use it for a
demonstration. `outreg` works with standard R regressions (`lm`,
`glm`).  Suppose we have data about cancer prevalence (y) and predictors
including exposure to plutonium (x1), vegetables (x2), and tobacco (x3). 

```{r fakedata, include=F}
library(rockchalk)
dat <- genCorrelatedData2(N = 1000, rho = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.7),
                          beta = c(1, 1.0, -1.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 0.1), stde = 1)
```

Regressions are estimated. The second regression includes
interactions.

```{r reg10, echo=T, results="hide"}
m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = dat)
m2 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2*x3 + x1*x3, data = dat)

```

The variable labels are created as `varLab` and they are supplied in
the call to `outreg`. 

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r reg20, results="asis"}
varLab <- c(y = "Cancer", x1 = "Plutonium", x2 = "Veggies",
            x3 = "Tobacco", `x2:x3` = "Veg $\\times$ Tob",
            `x1:x3` = "Plut $\\times$ Tob")
or10 <- outreg(list("Cancer OLS" = m1, "Cancer Interaction" = m2), 
               tight=FALSE, varLab = varLab)
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

The table is inserted flush left in the document at the point of the
code chunk because I did not create a floating table object in which
to situate it.

```{r reg20, echo=F, results="asis"}
varLab <- c(y = "Cancer", x1 = "Plutonium", x2 = "Veggies",
            x3 = "Tobacco", `x2:x3` = "Veg $\\times$ Tob",
            `x1:x3` = "Plut $\\times$ Tob")
or10 <- outreg(list("Cancer OLS" = m1, "Cancer Interaction" = m2),
               tight=FALSE, varLab = varLab)
```


The other way to do this is to save the table in a file, and then
include it in a document.  I do this in some reports because the
\LaTeX\ (or HTML) tables created by software are never *exactly* right
and I want to fine tune them.

```{r reg30}
cat(or10, file = "tmpout/or10file.tex")
```

The file "or10file.tex" can be edited by hand, and then inserted into
the \LaTeX\ document (for the PDF backend). If I am using this method,
I can insert a floating table with a proper caption and label. See
Table \ref{tab:reg30}, which results from the following.  

```
\begin{table} \caption{Regression Analysis\label{tab:reg30}}
\input{tmpout/or10file.tex} \end{table} 
``` 

\begin{table}
\caption{Regression Analysis\label{tab:reg30}}
\input{tmpout/or10file.tex} 
\end{table}

Admittedly, this two step process to create the floating \LaTeX\ label
is not truly necessary.  The `outreg` function could do that for
us. The same result using the results="asis" chunk:

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r reg40, results="asis"}
or10 <- outreg(list("Cancer OLS" = m1, "Cancer Interaction" = m2), tight=FALSE,
               varLab = varLab, title = "Regression Analysis asdfasdf",
               label="tab:reg30")
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

Because this document is intended for the PDF backend, any \LaTeX\
generating table function should work.  For linear regressions,
multilevel models, and glm fits, I find the `rockchalk::outreg` output
is fine, but other kinds of models often arrive with custom
table-making routines. I have not found a single approach that works
beautifully for all kinds of regressions, and I expect other authors
will say the same thing because new packages to create \LaTeX\ tables
seem to crop up in the R repositories on a monthly basis. It is worth
mentioning that some of the \LaTeX\ table generators, like `texreg`,
allow the use of `bookman` markup to beautify the placement of
horizontal lines, so the document preamble must be modified to include
that package.

I often need to include simpler tabular material in documents and I
always try to use the package `xtable`. `xtable` is not the simplest
package, but it has been around longer than the others and it has more
detailed features than any other package. In particular, the
`longtable` class, which allows tables that gracefully split over
"page breaks", is available. If I cannot get the result I want with
`xtable`, the second approach I try is the `latex` function in the
`Hmisc` package. There are plenty of other table-making R packages,
but my opinion is that if one can master `xtable`, then one can
generate just about any kind of table.

## Warnings, cautions, etc.

### Dialects
R markdown is similar to, but the exactly the same, as the [general
markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
It is different from other specialized dialects, such as the [GitHub
Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm) and other
variants. Be cautious about using style guides that are not intended
explicitly for `R markdown` documents. There is a good chance the
advice about preparing a document from those other sites is irrelevant
to an `R markdown` document. Google searches will sometimes lead to
the wrong answer for a particular form of Markdown.

### Inaccurate rendering

Another major concern is that illegal \LaTeX\ code in documents
intended for HTML will be ignored in the document production process.
The document compiles without error, but HTML result is
incomplete. Where we expect to see math, there is *empty nothing*.  By
itself, this problem seems serious enough to make me think the HTML
backend should not be used. The `markdown` $\rightarrow$ HTML conversion is the
weak spot. The `markdown` $\rightarrow$ PDF transition is not similarly
flawed. It halts with error messages.  The conclusion from all of this
is the following: 

> *Authors must exert themselves to proofread the
> HTML output to make sure it appears as intended.*

Another problem we have discovered is that even valid HTML markup can
sometimes be corrupted by `pandoc`. Valid HTML (and PDF, for that
matter) can include empty spaces that are inserted by authors to make
their markup easier to read.  The spaces are confusing to `pandoc`,
which may interpret them as markdown formatting statements (markdown
uses spaces to indicate nesting of lists or code sections.  At the
current time, it appears to be necessary to process all HTML markup
that goes into the markdown document to remove spaces in the beginning
of lines.

In our experimentation with R markdown, we have noticed another quirk.  I
document intended for PDF, one writes `\LaTeX` to produce \LaTeX. On
the other, in a document intended for HTML, writing `\LaTeX` produces
one of those empty spaces previously mentioned.  Instead, in the
document intended for HTML one must insert `$\LaTeX$`, as if this were
a valid mathematical expression, which it is not. Inserting `$\LaTeX$`
in `R markdown` intended for PDF results in an error message:

\begin{lstlisting}
! You can't use `\spacefactor' in math mode.
\@->\spacefactor
                 \@m {}
l.934 ...to compile and the error message \(\LaTeX

pandoc: Error producing PDF
\end{lstlisting}

## Mathjax needed for HTML documents

Finally, there is a fundamental weakness of HTML documents. Math is
not "in" the HTML file. Instead, there is javascript code that is
shown in the Web browser using a framework called MathJax. MathJax
allows inclusion of math markup in the page which--when the conditions
are right--can be converted by the Web browser to look like equations.
The MathJax display system works better and better over time; it
*almost always works*. The Web browser must be able to retrieve files
from the MathJax server in order to display the document.
If the reader is offline, or the MathJax server fails. Users will see
markup, rather than equations, when the network fails.

## Illegal encoding of pasted fonts

While working on this document, I found a web page with a lovely
Shakespeare sonnet. I carelessly copy/pasted that into a code
listing. Look what happened at compile time:

```
pauljohn@delllap-16:vignettes$ ./rmd2html.sh Rmarkdown.Rmd
Error in tools::file_path_as_absolute(output_file) :
  file 'Rmarkdown.pdf' does not exist
Calls: rmd2html -> do.call -> <Anonymous> -> <Anonymous>
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In grep(paste(r, collapse = "|"), text, value = TRUE) :
  input string 1312 is invalid in this locale
2: In grep("^\\s*$", x) : input string 1312 is invalid in this locale
3: In grep("^! ", x) : input string 1312 is invalid in this locale
4: In grep("^\\s*$", x) : input string 1312 is invalid in this locale
5: In grep("^! ", x) : input string 1312 is invalid in this locale
6: In file.rename(file_with_ext(texfile, "pdf"), output_file) :
Execution halted
```

The error message means that there were some characters in the web page that were encoded in an unfamiliar format. 


## Bibliographical citation test is appropriate. 

A citation with name and date is obtained as
[@diggle_analysis_2013]. A citation that with just the date, i.e.,
Diggle and colleagues [-@diggle_analysis_2013, 37] is obtained
differently. To get the full parenthesized statement with names and
dates, we insert hard brackets `[`, an `@` sign, the bibtex tag, and
acloser `]`. If we don't want their names, we insert a `-` sign. It is
also possible to refer to a group of projects [@hsiao_analysis_2014;
@fitzmaurice_applied_2011; @mccullagh_nelder_1983].

In HTML output, the references are always generated as the very 
last piece of the document. We insert a section name in the very
last line to prepare for than.

```
# References
``` 

In HTML output, the style of the bibliography will not match what we
generally want. What we get is close, the Chicago author-year
format. We need a "CSL" file to alter the style of the output. See
[authoring_bibliographies_and_citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

If the back end is PDF, as in this document, there is some more
encouraging news.  A combination of YAML header magic and some "raw"
LaTeX succeeds in creating a bibliography for this document.

# Conclusion

For the sake of clarity, then, I state the following:

> If the backend in PDF, one should should use functions that
> provide tables using \LaTeX\ code.

On the other hand, 

> if the backend is HTML, then functions that create HTML markup code
> should be used.
