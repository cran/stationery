                   come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such
                   as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The
                   challenge of understanding these data has led to the
                   development of new tools in the field of statistics,
                   and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine
                   learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have

                   different terminology. This book describes the
                   important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual
                   framework. While the approach is statistical, the
                   emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many

                   edition of this successful book has been completely
                   updated to take into account the many developments in
                   the area over the last few years. It features three new
                   chapters on models for continuous non-normal data, on
                   various design issues specific to repeated
                   measurements, and on missing data and dropouts.
                   Exercises have been added at the ends of most chapters,
                   and the software for carrying out the analyses is now
                   available to the public. The book begins with a
                   development of the general context of repeated
                   measurements. It then describes the three basic types
                   of response variables--continuous (normal),
                   categorical, and count data--and develops a practical
                   framework for creating suitable models and for applying
                   ideas on multivariate distributions and stochastic
                   processes. The book then devotes three sections to
                   examining a large number of concrete examples,
                   including data tables, to illustrate the models

                   results. Misspecification, inefficiency, bias,
                   inconsistency, insufficiency, and other problems result
                   from the unknowing application of two common methods
                   that are without theoretical justification or empirical
                   utility in this type of data. I show that the
                   exponential Poisson regression (EPR) model provides
                   analytically, in large samples, and empirically, in
                   small, finite samples, a far superior model and optimal
                   estimator. I also demonstrate the advantage of this
                   methodology in an application to nineteenth-century
                   party switching in the U.S. Congress. Its use by
                   political scientists is strongly encouraged.},

                   advanced topics related to multilevel analysis. The
                   editors assembled the top minds in the field to address
                   the latest applications of multilevel modeling as well
                   as the specific difficulties and methodological
                   problems that are becoming more common as more
                   complicated models are developed. Each chapter features
                   examples that use actual datasets. These datasets, as
                   well as the code to run the models, are available on
                   the book’s website http://www.hlm-online.com . Each
                   chapter includes an introduction that sets the stage
                   for the material to come and a conclusion. Divided into
                   five sections, the first provides a broad introduction
                   to the field that serves as a framework for
                   understanding the latter chapters. Part 2 focuses on
                   multilevel latent variable modeling including item
                   response theory and mixture modeling. Section 3
                   addresses models used for longitudinal data including
                   growth curve and structural equation modeling. Special
                   estimation problems are examined in section 4 including
                   the difficulties involved in estimating survival
                   analysis, Bayesian estimation, bootstrapping, multiple
                   imputation, and complicated models, including
                   generalized linear models, optimal design in multilevel
                   models, and more. The book’s concluding section
                   focuses on statistical design issues encountered when
                   doing multilevel modeling including nested designs,
                   analyzing cross-classified models, and dyadic data
                   analysis. Intended for methodologists, statisticians,
                   and researchers in a variety of fields including
                   psychology, education, and the social and health
                   sciences, this handbook also serves as an excellent
                   text for graduate and PhD level courses in multilevel
                   modeling. A basic knowledge of multilevel modeling is

                   multilevel techniques to their research. Noted as an
                   accessible introduction, the book also includes
                   advanced extensions, making it useful as both an
                   introduction and as a reference to students,
                   researchers, and methodologists. Basic models and
                   examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an
                   emphasis on understanding the methodological and
                   statistical issues involved in using these models. The
                   estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is
                   demonstrated using realistic examples from various
                   disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets
                   on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses,
                   street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric
                   scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on
                   the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus
                   files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel
                   regression model and multilevel structural models.
                   Highlights of the second edition include: Two new
                   chapters―one on multilevel models for ordinal and
                   count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival
                   analysis (Ch. 8). Thoroughly updated chapters on
                   multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect
                   the enormous technical progress of the last few years.
                   The addition of some simpler examples to help the
                   novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine
                   more than one problem have been retained. A new section
                   on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11). Expanded
                   discussions of covariance structures across time and
                   analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected.
                   Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous
                   data and proportions with new estimation methods. An
                   updated website at http://www.joophox.net/ with data
                   sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen
                   shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors. Ideal for
                   introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones
                   that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a
                   variety of disciplines including: psychology,
                   education, sociology, the health sciences, and
                   business. The advanced extensions also make this a
                   favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in
                   these disciplines. A basic understanding of ANOVA and
                   multiple regression is assumed. The section on
                   multilevel structural equation models assumes a basic
                   understanding of SEM.},

                   modelling, but choosing the optimal number and
                   positions of knots is a complex task. Equidistant knots
                   can be used, but their small and discrete number allows
                   only limited control over smoothness and fit. We
                   propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a
                   difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent
                   \$B\$-splines. We show connections to the familiar
                   spline penalty on the integral of the squared second

In addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden. Implementing Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately reproduce a scientific result.   Divided into three parts, the book discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring reproducibility in computational science. It describes:   Computational tools, such as Sweave, knitr, VisTrails, Sumatra, CDE, and the Declaratron system Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research Software and methodological platforms, including open source software packages, RunMyCode platform, and open access journals  Each part presents contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products that have advanced the field.

  abstract   = {bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown presents a much easier way to write books and technical publications than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C++, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},
