# Introduction

## Insert author information in the yaml header

It is necessary for the author to edit the yaml header of this
document to specify the title, author data, address and the name of a
logo file.

# We use a template file

The look and feel of the document will be controlled by a template
file. It is specified in the header as "theme/report-template.tex".
 
In July 2018, we learned how to selectively override settings
from the document's yaml header.  These alternative parameters
can be specified either as command line arguments to `rmd2pdf.sh`
or as parameters in the R function call `rmd2pdf`. 

# Compile the document

If the user starts an R session, she can run the `rmd2pdf` function
with many optional arguments, as follows:

    > rmd2pdf("skeleton.Rmd", toc=FALSE, template="theme/report-template.tex")

From the command line, the same file can be compiled using notation
that is nearly identical

    $ ./rmd2pdf.sh --toc=FALSE --template='"theme/report-template.tex"' skeleton.Rmd
	
Note the single quotes protect the double quotes.

The template can, of course, be edited for your purposes. The
formatting for the header is tricky, but in most of the other parts,
it is fairly obvious how this can be customized. An important thing to
remember is that a template file treats dollar signs `$` as special
symbols, so if one intends to insert a literal dollar sign in the
template, one enters two dollar signs (`$$`).

If this document is edited in **Rstudio**, the "knit" menu sometimes does
not work correctly. We notice that Rstudio will sometimes alter the
document yaml header in a harmful way, but this does not always
happen.  If you open the Rnw file in Rstudio, click "Knit" and choos
"knit to pdf", it is very likely to work. However, if you accidentally
choose "knit to HTML", then Rstudio will alter the header and the
document will not compile correctly any more.  It seems like a mistake
to allow the editor to alter the content of the header.

Users who do not want to bother with the command line arguments can
edit the `rmd2pdf.sh` script and change the defaults for the
parameters in the obvious way at the top of the file.

The `rmd2pdf` function (and shell script) will also generate a 
"purled" copy of the R code chunks. The term "purled" is equivalent
to "tangled" in the Sweave chunk engine.  The user can specify
either `purl=TRUE` or `tangle=TRUE`, the script will treat them
as equivalent.


# Formatting Input

## Much \LaTeX\ Syntax is allowed

This is not true only for math, but also other \LaTeX environments.

This is explained in the `crmda` package vignette `Rmarkdown`. 
Not all \LaTeX markup will work well, but most will. 

CAUTION: Some \LaTeX will fail without warning or error
messages. Careful proof reading of output is essential.  The markdown
to PDF conversion does not warn us of unrecognized LaTeX code.  The
result is not an error, but rather "empty white space" where the user
expects \LaTeX output.

## Equations

Use `\[` and `\[` for display equations. Do not use the 
double dollar signs:

\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]

To create a numbered equation, do this

\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}\label{eq:sigma}
\end{equation}

and cross-reference that as equation (\ref{eq:sigma}).

## Document customization: essentials

With the `stationery` package, we provide generic logos as
placeholders.  Feel free to replace them with your own logos.
Most of the example documents have a code chunk that copies
the logo files from an R packages. That `themecopy`
stanza can be removed after the document is compiled for the first
time, it will not replace a user-edited file from the theme directory
with a new copy.  We usually leave that chunk, so that we can 
delete the theme folder and it will be replaced when the document
is compiled.

## Customizations requiring more \LaTeX packages

In addition, if you insert \LaTeX features that require packages that
are not currently in the template `report-template.tex`, then those
packages can be inserted into the preamble by YAML header markup like
so:

```
header-includes:
-  \usepackage{xcolor}
-  \usepackage{amsmath}
-  \usepackage{amssymb}
-  \usepackage{fancybox}
```

We have added many packages in the template already, and we have
tested that, even when the template parameter is used, the
header-includes values are taken into account by the compiling
process.



# `R` code chunks

In our report style, the author will not generally insert visible code
chunks, so almost always the chunk will have the flag `include=FALSE`
or, if the chunk is included, the code will not be echoed, but perhaps
a \LaTeX mark-up table or a figure may be placed into the document.

The process for doing this depends on the document type. As explained
in the `crmda` vignette `code_chunks`, the appearance of code
chunks--whether they are revealed in the document at all--is
controlled by many options.

One approach might be to use one document to create graphs or tables,
which are then to be saved in a folder (such as our tmpout folder,
which is used in this document). This chunk code will create the
output file "tmpout/p-hist-1.pdf"

```{r hist, include=F, fig.cap = "One caption that is not used for anything because the image is not included in a float"}
set.seed(234234)
x <- rnorm(1000)
hist(x, main = "A Histogram", xlab = "Random Normal Data, N = 1000")
```

\begin{lstlisting}
`r ''````{r hist, include=F, caption = "One Histogram"}
x <- rnorm(1000)
hist(x, main = "Random Normal Data", xlab = "N(0,1) (1000 observations)")
`r ''````
\end{lstlisting}

The graphic file, "tmpout/p-hist-1.pdf", is a picture, it does not
have the code with it to make it "float" in the document. Observe
that it is just "paste in" at the current location:

\includegraphics[width=4in]{tmpout/p-hist-1}

On the other hand, if we want a floating figure to be produced
automatically, we can change the code slightly:

```{r hist20, fig.cap="\\label{fig:hist20}One Histogram that Floats Automatically", fig.width=4}
x <- rnorm(1000)
hist(x, main = "", xlab = "Random Normal Data, N = 1000")
```

Note we forced a label into the caption itself with \LaTeX\ code.  We
can use a cross reference to identify that. We'd write as in Figure
\ref{fig:hist20}, we get a fabulous result. 

It shouldn't be necessary to wedge a label in with the caption as we
did, but the "automatic" ways is not working today. If it works
for you, please tell me how.

There are several R packages intended to create "ready to publish"
\LaTeX tables. One of the oldest and most venerable of these is
`xtable`, which we use here to create a simple table that displays
as a cross tabulation table.

When the \LaTeX output is going directly into the document, the
chunk flag is "results='asis'" and the echo parameter should be FALSE.
The default configuration for xtable is to create tables that are
floating \LaTeX objects.

```{r ex-1, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
y <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(head(data.frame(x, y), 10),
    caption = "Ten Lines from One Data Frame",
    label="tab:onedf")
print(xt, floating = TRUE, comment = FALSE,
      include.rownames = FALSE, caption.placement = "top")
```

See the help pages for `xtable` and `print.xtable` to find out all of
the possible arguments.  If one does intend to have the output go
directly into the document, without any hand editing, it is almost
certainly necessary to specify a large number of arguments.

It may be more workable to write the \LaTeX file on disk and then
double-check its contents before manual inclusion in the document. If
a LaTeX table file has been created from another document, we do not
recommend "cutting and pasting" into this document.  Instead, use
"\textbackslash{}input{filename}".

The following code chunk will save the same \LaTeX markup table
in a file.

```{r ex-2, include=FALSE}
print(xt, file = "tmpout/p-ex-2.tex", floating = TRUE, comment = FALSE,
      include.rownames = FALSE, caption.placement = "top")
```


# Bibliographical citations. {-}

This document is produced with R [@RCore]. Here's a citation that
excludes some author names [-@diggle_analysis_2013, p. 37]. Note that
to get the full parenthesized statement with names and dates, we
insert hard brackets `[`, an `@` sign, the bibtex tag, and a closer
`]`. If we don't want their names, we insert a `-` sign. It is also
possible to refer to a group of projects [@hsiao_analysis_2014;
@fitzmaurice_applied_2011; @mccullagh_nelder_1983].

Because this document is going to be compiled to a PDF back end via
latex, it is also allowed to use LaTeX style natbib citations, which
are considerably more flexible.  Concerning R
\citep{venablesripley2000}, the result is the same for the basic
citation.

A citation that has three authors [@diggle_analysis_2013], using
the markdown style, and a citation that has three authors, using
the LaTeX natbib markup \citep{hastie_elements_2009}.

One of the reasons why the APA citations are desirable, and also a
pain, is that the APA has very picky requirements about how the
citations appear in the document. Note the in-text parenthesized
citations use the ampersand, where humans might use the word "and".
On the other hand, if only the date is parenthesized, the
"\textbackslash{}citet" results in \citet{hastie_elements_2009}.
But if we want to write names, we can get that with
"\textbackslash{}citeyearpar", as in Hastie, Tibshirani, and 
Friedman \citeyearpar{hastie_elements_2009}.

The bibliographic format is using the apacite package for LaTeX.



# Session Info

Reports do not include the R session replication information, generally 
speaking.  However, compiling the document will produce a
record-keeping file in which the session information is saved. This
will be in the current working directory.

```{r session, include=F}
zz <- gsub("Rmd", "Rout", knitr::current_input())
capture.output(sessionInfo(), file = zz, append = TRUE)
if (!is.null(warnings())){
    capture.output(warnings(), file = zz)
}
```
