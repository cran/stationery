more code and raw output than report documents would.  This abstract

# Nuts and Bolts

## Fix the title and other document-specific information 

The header has a place to insert a title, subtitle, email
addresses. Do not change the `pdf_document` settings unless you want
to get serious.

## To compile this document

This is discussed in detail in the stationery vignette.

To compile, either start R and use the function `rmd2pdf` or use the
shell script `rmd2pdf.sh` that is in the same directory as the `Rmd`
file. The function `rmd2pdf` (same as the script) will receive
arguments that override the settings within the document header. For
example, one could replace the template by specifying 

```
rmd2pdf("instructions.Rmd", template = "theme/myothertemplate.tex")
```

It is tricky to provide the same setting in the command line script
because of quotation marks. One would run

```
./rmd2pdf.sh --template='"theme/myothertemplate.tex"' instructions.Rmd
```
supplies settings. The
user can supply many arguments to control the table of contents and so
forth.

Compiling the document will also produce an R file that is a "tangled"
version of the code chunks in the document.

## Document customization: essentials


The document header depends on a \LaTeX template called
"guide-template.tex".  That will be copied to the theme directory
the first time a document is compiled in this directory. If you do
want to edit the theme template, edit
theme/guide-template.tex. Make sure the compiler uses that
document.  If you use our compiler script or the R function rmd2pdf,
it is necessary to supply the template argument with the function
call.

That is, it is not sufficient to insert a template name in the YAML
header, and it is also not sufficient to use Rstudio's "knit" menu.
One must specify the template argument with `rmd2pdf`.


# Section Headers

Insert section titles with `#`, `##`, as in markdown. Sections are
numbered, by default, to prevent that insert a ` {-}` after, as
demonstrated next

# LaTeX Syntax is allowed {-}

This is explained in the `stationery` package vignette `Rmarkdown`.
Use `\[` and `\[` for unnumbered display equations:

\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]


\[
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}
\]

For a numbered
display, use `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}`, and insert a
label that can be referenced later:

\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{gt}=\Lambda_{gt}\Psi_{gt}\Lambda'_{gt}+\Theta_{gt}\label{eq:sem}
\end{equation}

To demonstrate a cross-reference, that is equation
(\ref{eq:sem}). Note this will only work with "rmd2pdf" documents, not
when HTML is the output target. If we put in another equation, you
will see it is automatically numbered:

\begin{equation}
y_i=\beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_i\label{eq:reg}
\end{equation}

That's equation (\ref{eq:reg}).

## Additional LaTeX packages

In addition, if you insert \LaTeX features that require packages
that are not currently in the report-template.tex, then those
packages can be inserted into the preamble by YAML header markup like
so:

```
header-includes:
-  \usepackage{xcolor}
-  \usepackage{amsmath}
-  \usepackage{amssymb}
-  \usepackage{fancybox}
```

We found out we needed `amssymb` in several projects. 

# `R` code chunks {-}

This document includes R[@RCore] code chunks.

In guide documents, we *do* generally include input and output from code
chunks. There is a vignette "code_chunks" distributed with this
package to demonstrate. 

Please **DO** name each chunk. This improves your ability to
troubleshoot the compiling and tangling processes.

First, create a data frame

```{r ex-1}
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
y <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
dat <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)
```

Of course, because this is guide, we are also likely to have some ugly
raw R output.

```{r ex-4}
summary(dat)
```

The document template controls the numbering of lines. This can be
changed by altering the template.

We can show ugly output if we really need to. But we'd rather include
lovely graphs or nicely formatted \LaTeX tables.

When tables are concerned, the placement of tables is the major issue.
Sometimes we like tables that are "numbered floating"
objects. However, because this is a guide document, we might want the
\LaTeX table output to show "right here" (prevent it from floating
into a numbered table). The following code shows that the `print.xtable`
method from the `xtable` package allows us to control that.

The following creates output that does not go into a floating
object. Note the output will blurt into the document, immediately
after the code chunk itself:

```{r ex-2, results='asis', echo=TRUE}
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(head(dat, 10), caption="Ten Lines from One Data Frame",
             label="tab:ex2")
print(xt, comment=FALSE, include.rownames=FALSE, floating=FALSE)
```
Note that because the print.xtable arguments include "floating=FALSE",
the table caption is not printed with the output table.  The concept
of caption is meaningful only for floating tables, as we illustrate next.

A more professional result is obtained if we allow `xtable` to create a
"floating" table object.  The following code creates Table
\ref{tab:ex2}.

```{r ex-3, results='asis', echo=TRUE}
print(xt, comment=FALSE, include.rownames=FALSE, floating=TRUE,
      caption.placement = "top")
```

For whatever reason, the custom is that captoins (titles) of tables are placed
**on top** while titles for figures are placed on the bottom.

As explained in the `stationery` vignette `code_chunks`, many 
options are avaiable for code chunks.


# Bibliographical citations. {-}

This document is produced with R [@RCore]. Here's a citation that
excludes some author names [-@diggle_analysis_2013, p. 37]. Note that
to get the full parenthesized statement with names and dates, we
insert hard brackets `[`, an `@` sign, the bibtex tag, and a closer
`]`. If we don't want their names, we insert a `-` sign. It is also
possible to refer to a group of projects [@hsiao_analysis_2014;
@fitzmaurice_applied_2011; @mccullagh_nelder_1983].

Because this document is going to be compiled to a PDF back end via
latex, it is also allowed to use LaTeX style natbib citations, which
are considerably more flexible.  Concerning R
\citep{venablesripley2000}, the result is the same for the basic
citation.

A citation that has three authors [@diggle_analysis_2013], using
the markdown style, and a citation that has three authors, using
the LaTeX natbib markup \citep{hastie_elements_2009}.

One of the reasons why the APA citations are desirable, and also a
pain, is that the APA has very picky requirements about how the
citations appear in the document. Note the in-text parenthesized
citations use the ampersand, where humans might use the word "and".
On the other hand, if only the date is parenthesized, the
"\textbackslash{}citet" results in \citet{hastie_elements_2009}.
But if we want to write names, we can get that with
"\textbackslash{}citeyearpar", as in Hastie, Tibshirani, and 
Friedman \citeyearpar{hastie_elements_2009}.

The bibliographic format is using the apacite package for LaTeX.

# Session Info

This is a required element in a guide

```{r session}
sessionInfo()
if (!is.null(warnings())){
    print("Warnings:")
    warnings()
}
