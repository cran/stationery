\begin_layout Abstract
\noindent
The stationery package offers working examples for preparation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reproducible research
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 documents.
 It demonstrates how one can create and customize the style of both markdown
 and LaTeX documents.
 These formats utilize R's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

code chunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 processing technology, so that code that creates figures and tables can
 be embedded into the document itself.
 The package includes 8 document templates.
 The vignettes that accompany the package provide elementary explanations
 of the formats and how they differ in practice.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction

Reproducible research documents?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A university administrator recently exclaimed, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have no idea what that means!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Many members of the faculty seem to have the same response.
 The 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
stationery
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package for R is here to help.
 It offers working examples that new users may explore to find out what
 works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The big idea of the 
\emph on
reproducible research documents
\emph default
 movement (

;

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) is to replace traditional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cut and paste
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 research reports with a program-driven documentation system that blends
 calculations with report preparation.
 Researchers who use word processors have long been aware of the danger
 that computer code and output tables fall into misalignment.
 Hand edited tables are often incorrect, misplacing decimal points and parameter
 names.
 Proponents of reproducible documents ask us to change our workflow in a
 fundamental way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my experience, the benefits of this new approach are especially notable
 in class notes, slides, and small to medium sized reports.
 A chronic problem for teachers is a misalignment of computer code and output
 in course materials.
 It is easy to forget to paste in an updated graph or modify a table.
 With a reproducible document, there is less danger that the computer code
 being discussed will not match the output.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\emph on
new way
\emph default
 of doing things, we avoid typing tables or pasting in graphs.
 The analysis software will prepare article-ready tables and graphs that
 can be put to use with no (or almost no) revision.
 In the ideal case, an entire article, lecture, or book can be generated
 in one single execution that conducts analysis, saves graphics, and assembles
 them together in the output document.
 This is in line with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

literate programming
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 movement started by computer scientist Donald Knuth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "knuth_literate_1984"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "knuth_texbook_1984"

\end_inset

), who also created the TeX document preparation system.
 The statistical program R 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RCore"

\end_inset

 built its documentation framework on the literate programming philosophy,
 integrating Knuth's concepts of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

weaving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tangling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the R system for creating documentation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "leisch2002"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most word-processor-using researchers, the transition will be jarring.
 First, the tools for statistical analysis (e.g., SAS, SPSS, Stata, or Mplus)
 that used to seem adequate are to be replaced with statistical software
 that is more readily integrated with document preparation.
 Second, the software for document authoring is being replaced.
 Microsoft Word is, simply put, insufficient.
 There is new priority on the integration of code and output within documents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we understand that 
\emph on
big idea
\emph default
, then comes another series of rude shocks.
 First, 
\emph on
there are several competing formats 
\emph default
for creating reproducible documents.
 The first examples prepared for this package were done with LaTeX in mind,
 but we have introduced a set of examples based on R markdown as well.
 The examples include code for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LaTeX and LyX (a graphical interface for LaTeX document preparation, 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Markdown document formats are, at least superficially, simpler.
 Their content may seem less obscured by formatting code.
 For example, in LaTeX to insert a bold font, one would write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
textbf{this is bold}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, but in most dialects of markdown, a simpler 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
**this is bold**
\end_layout

\end_inset

 would get the job done.
 Markdown is a reasonably legible format 
\emph on
as is
\emph default
, and yet it can be compiled into more professional output formats.
 The leading voice for markdown has been John Gruber, whose Daring Fireball
 website (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) offered the first
 working set of guidelines for markdown documents.
 Markdown is more like a movement than language, since there are many competing
 versions (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the language specification.
 The success of markdown depends, in a very practical way, on the success
 of John MacFarlane's ambitious software program 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, a translator and compiler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my experience, it is relatively easy to build a simple document with
 either LaTeX or markdown.
 It is considerably more difficult to create a nice-looking document that
 incorporates the special features that we are used to in reports.
 And it is considerably more difficult to re-style the output to match user-driv
en specifications.
 The 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 package reflects the accumulated effort (and frustration) of several generation
s of graduate research assistants who have struggled to reconcile the reproducib
le document idea into demands of an organization that wants to issue visually
 consistent guides and reports.

In this context, it is a bit vague to say

 because each document is converted through several formats in the compilation
 process.
 Any intermediate format that precedes another might be edited directly
 and treated as a front end by an author.

stationery
\end_layout

 package includes examples for eight types of documents (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The document types 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mix and match
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 front ends, back ends, and document styles.
 We hope that authors who are accustomed to writing on stationery, with
 a pleasant header and footer, will find satisfactory results.
 Each document style includes theme files.
 While it is not easy to create these style templates, we believe it will
 be easier for others succeed if they start from the examples we offer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package provides R functions to initialize skeleton documents and convert
 them to a desired back end.
 It also provides a shell script with each document type that can be used
 to compile documents from the command line.

Finally, there are vignettes.
 In addition to the current document, there are vignettes named

The process of converting a reproducible document from front end to back
 end is referred to as 
\emph on
compiling
\emph default
.
 As illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Compiling"

\end_inset

, it is a multi-step process.
 Because the process can fail at any step, users are well advised to keep
 this fact in mind.
 There will be flaws in documents that can only be discerned by inspecting
 each stage in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the front end and the back end intermediate files are created (and
 just as quickly erased).
 One of the current aims in software development is to make the transition
 process automatic and seamless, but errors at each stage are still fairly
 common.
 One challenge is to retain some flexibility for user input while weeding
 out compilation errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX authors are used to editing .tex files, but 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is usually an intermediate format in this work.
 When code chunks are inserted in a LaTeX file, the document is referred
 to as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noweb
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file and the filename suffix is 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 That file is converted into a 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file by the chunk converter.
 (If one is editing a 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LyX
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file, the converter will export to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as a first step.) The intermediate LaTeX files will be compiled, usually
 by 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pdflatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 An R markdown document, which has the suffix 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 while 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 If one has created tens or 100s of documents, the ability to re-style them

 a major advantage.

Whether one is editing in a LaTeX or a markdown file, there will be code
 chunks.
 In markdown documents, code chunks are bracketed by tick marks:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the pivotal stages in document compilation is the conversion of code
 chunks into formats suitable for inclusion in the document.
 At this point, we arrive at a somewhat unhappy situation because there
 are competing programs and terminology.
 Knuth referred to the chunk conversion process as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weaving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The base R framework refers to chunk conversion as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sweaving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (because S was the precursor to R; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 The newer 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
knitr
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xie_knitr"

\end_inset

 package for R refers to the chunk-conversion process as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knitting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, although it is doing the same work as Sweaving.
 Another problem in terminology is that Knuth used the unlikely term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tangle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to refer to extraction of code chunks to create a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free standing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program (a program document separate from the commentary about it).
 Base R refers to that by the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stangle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use shell commands
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For the sake of completeness, we begin with the most basic method: run commands
 in a terminal.
 For a LaTeX file, such as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
crmda.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

, this is straightforward.
 First, convert the code chunks to R input:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ R CMD Sweave crmda.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That creates 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
crmda.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which is then converted to PDF output: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ texi2pdf crmda.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command line options to compile a file with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 code chunks is a bit more elaborate.
 I generally use the R functions or shell scripts described next.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 formats.
 For example, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "style=Rinput"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

library(stationery)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

rmd2pdf("crmda.Rmd")

This orchestrates a two-part process that involves functions in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rmarkdown
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
knitr
\end_layout

\end_inset

 packages.
 The document header is scanned and then a suitable document format object
 is created.
 The heavy lifting is done by the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pdf_document
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
html_document
\end_layout

\end_inset

 functions in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rmarkdown
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package.
 The code chunks in the .Rmd file will be converted to output chunks in an
 intermediate file named 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
crmda.utf8.md
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 After that, intermediate documents must be rendered to the final result.
 The benefit of using the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
stationery
\end_layout

\end_inset

 functions is that they will review the in-document format settings, but
 can override them with function parameters.
 For example, one can control the creation of a table of contents by including
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
toc: true
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rmd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 document, or by running 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pdf_document
\end_layout

\end_inset

 with the parameter 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
toc = TRUE
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Any of the document parameters can be selectively replaced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a use case, suppose we write three R markdown documents and we forget
 to specify the depth of the table of contents.
 Rather than editing each individual document to insert 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
toc_depth:1
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we might instead specify the depth as an R function argument:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<usage110, eval=F>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

rmd2pdf(c("crmda1.Rmd", "crmda2.Rmd", "crmda3.Rmd"), toc = TRUE, toc_depth
 = 1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a template can be substituted by employing the template argument,
 such as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
template = "theme/report-newtemplate.tex"
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are differences in format between the values in the markdown document
 preamble and the R function call.
 R uses 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_layout

\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NULL
\end_layout

\end_inset

 where markdown uses lower case 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
true
\end_layout

\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Run the shell script provided with the template.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The document skeleton is provided with a compiler script.
 It can do the same work as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rmd2pdf
\end_layout

\end_inset

 inside R.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ ./rmd2pdf.sh crmda.Rmd
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compiler script is designed to accept the same arguments as the function
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rmd2pdf
\end_layout

\end_inset

, but in the command line it is a little tricky to specify the options because
 character variables require quotation marks, and quotation marks need to
 be protected from interpretation by the shell.
 Here we protect double quotes in single quotes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ ./rmd2pdf.sh --template='"theme/report-newtemplate.tex"' --toc=TRUE --toc_depth=1
 crmda.Rmd

 across document types.
 Reports created with markdown or LaTeX should look the same.
 Results created by documents using either Sweave or knitr for chunk processing

 The difference between these two is not hard-and-fast.
 A 
\series bold
guide

 is usually prepared as a teaching document.
 It may end up in a Webpage, where more color rather than less is expected.
 It is usually a less formal document.
 The final presentation is likely to include computer code and output excerpts.
 The header is a three column structure with organizational and/or departmental
 logos on either side (see Figure

 for an example).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A

 is a more formal document.
 Its first page includes a header and a footer with organizational address
 information (see Figure

\end_inset

).
 The header and footer appear only on the first page.
 It is more is suitable for preparation of a report to clients or a draft
 of a journal article.
 A report typically has less (maybe no) code and almost never will it include
 "raw output" from a computer program.
 A report includes tables and figures that are in a (nearly) publishable
 format.

 As exemplified in Listing

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 A standard set of parameters is specified by

One of the benefits of the markdown preamble is that one can specify a authors
 in a flexible way, providing one or more names that are gracefully handled
 during the rendering process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LaTeX, the tools to specify title and author information are not as flexible.
 The problem is solved by some LaTeX functions in our templates.
 These use recent innovations in the LaTeX programming interface.
 (Packages consistent with TexLive 2016 or newer will be required).
 The top portion of the LaTeX document, where we expect the author to include
 the metadata, is illustrated in Listing 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{lis:latex1}.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The input format is similar to the markdown format, but there are slight
 differences due to inherent differences in technology.
 However, the output is the same (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LaTeX-Output"

\end_inset

).
 The LaTeX format allows us to keep the footer information–the address–in
 a separate file, so it need not be typed into each individual document
 (markdown does not allow that).

Hopefully, authors do not have too much trouble filling in their names and
 titles.
 There are not too many 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

gotchas
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but the use of illegal symbols for the intended back end may cause trouble.
 For example, LaTeX documents assign special meaning to symbols like

%
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

$
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

_

 In documents intended for HTML, titles or author names that include reserved
 symbols such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

HTML themes and the file size problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output size of HTML files may be quite large, even if the document itself

 This problem arises because 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

 uses a theme set based on the bootstrap library 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 If the markdown preamble does not specify a theme, or it specifies any
 theme except 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
null
\end_layout

\end_inset

, then a large amount of javascript and cascading style sheet data from
 bootstrap is inserted into the HTML header.
 This can take up to 700KB of storage.
 All of the other elements in the document, including its graphs and features,
 will take additional space.
 An R package that includes three HTML vignettes will exceed the CRAN limit
 on the size of packages.

 Preventing the insertion of the Bootstrap-based theme will reduce the HTML
 output file size to 62KB.
 (Note the author can insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in the markdown to prevent the use of a bootstrap theme (note that 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 Of course, the disadvantage of removing the theme is that the benefits
 of the theme are lost.
 In the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth mentioning that there are many bootstrap themes (they are listed
 in the help page for 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rmarkdown::html_document
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 One can explore the impact of these themes on the final document by running,
 for example, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Subsection
Troubleshooting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Documents often fail to compile.
 There are many failure points and one might need to inspect the intermediate
 files and output at several stages.
 When there is trouble, recompile with parameter values 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
clean = FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
quiet = FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and either 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
keep_md = TRUE
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (for HTML output) or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
keep_tex = TRUE
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (for PDF).
 By inspecting the intermediate files, editing them, and running the compiler
 commands again, one can usually find out what's wrong.
 During this process, it is beneficial to remember that the rendering process
 has separate stages, and each one can be run in isolation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
quiet = FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset

, one of the especially important parts of the verbose output is the full
 command that is sent to 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For example, compiling our minimal skeleton 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 yields this intimidating list of command line options

Choosing among formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We provide 8 document formats because there are several acceptable methods.
 Each one has strengths and weaknesses.
 At the current time, there is a considerable amount of enthusiasm about
 markdown.
 The markdown movement is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bleeding edge,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 literally, as the style for document markup and the development of software
 to convert documents into the final format is currently underway.
 The core program that handles markdown documents, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

, is undergoing rapid development.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Frequent changes in

\end_inset

 caused the RStudio program distribution to include a snapshot of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 so that their example documents can be compiled in a predictable way.
 We are warned that our templates for 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are likely to be made unworkable by revisions in the future and revisions
 will be necessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 On the other hand, the LaTeX-based approaches are time-tested and the compilers
 for them have existed for years.
 There are fewer surprises (bugs), but there are more details for authors
 to learn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A long run goal in the development of markdown is to create a single document
 that can be compiled into various formats.
 At the current time, that is an 
\emph on
aspiration
\emph default
, not a reality.
 Authors who prepare documents intended for one format will generally use
 features that are fundamentally incompatible with the other formats.
 As a result, the choice of the back end must be made first, and after that
 one can choose among features in the front end that are compatible with
 the desired result.
 Where you want to end up determines where you start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sort through these considerations, the right place to start is the end.
 After we figure out the end, we can concentrate on the beginning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Which back end?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should I end up with HTML or PDF? The answer depends on the intended audience/cl
ient.
 If a "paper" must be submitted, choose PDF.
 If the document needs numbered equations, cross references, and "floating"
 tables and figures, choose PDF.
 If the document is intended for a Webpage, then choose HTML (although we
 prefer to PDF document via the Web in many cases).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTML documents have hidden benefits and hidden costs.
 There is no free lunch.
 One can have features, but at the cost of large file sizes and (sometimes)
 unpredictable user experiences.
 Web browsers differ in their implementation of guidelines, javascript,
 and cascading style sheets.
 If one intends to convey a document in a replicable way to a wide audience
 using various kinds of computers, then PDF is the recommended format.
 The equations and figures are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the document and the author can be confident that they will have the same
 appearance across systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are other limitations in HTML.
 There is no built-in method for display of mathematical equations.
 There have been efforts to ameliorate that problem over the years, the
 most recent of which is called MathJax (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.mathjax.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 MathJax is a Web program that can be called when a user opens an HTML document.
 MathJax displays markup in a way that is similar to LaTeX output.
 However, in order for this to work, the conditions must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 First, if the remote server that provides MathJax is unavailable, then
 the math in the document will not be rendered.
 Second, some special care is required to allow MathJax equations in HTML
 documents that are based on markdown templates.
 The stationery package includes a special document format function, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
crmda_html_document
\end_layout

\end_inset

, that circumvents the limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What do the front end formats have in common?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, each one offers a method to include R code chunks.
 The formats and options differ, but the functionality is similar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, all of these formats allow authors to include LaTeX expressions
 for math.
 Much, but not all, LaTeX code will work in either format.
 Inline and display equations can work well in either, while many of the
 attendant features (numbered equations, cross references) are not available
 when the back end is HTML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, one can freely use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

native
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 code that is suitable for back end.
 In a markdown document for which the back end is HTML, one can insert HTML
 code.
 It will be passed through without alteration to the back end in most cases.
 If the back end is PDF (via pdflatex), any legal LaTeX code can be inserted
 in a markdown document.
 To an considerable degree, this solves the problem that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is no markdown for that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 R functions that can write output in LaTeX or HTML format can be exploited
 in this way.
 There is no need to write a new function to create regression tables.
 One can shop among the alternatives, knowing only that the output format
 must be suited to the back end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the inclusion of native code in a markdown document is viewed
 as something of a defeat.
 Markdown enthusiasts would be more enthusiastic if we would either 1) live
 within the limitations of their framework, or 2) do the work to broaden
 the framework itself.
 For the first few years after markdown was introduced, it was possible
 to insert graphics in the document, but it was not possible to resize their
 display width or height in markdown code.
 To work around that, we inserted native HTML code to resize graphics.
 Several years later 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 markdown introduced parameters to resize markdown images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What considerations differentiate the front ends?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original version of this document was prepared in R markdown that was
 compiled into HTML.
 There were several show-stopping flaws.
 Some features failed to compile, and some errors in my own code were silently
 ignored by the version of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that was available in 2017.
 The document was changed to LaTeX and PDF.
 When the back end format changed to PDF, several special features of the
 HTML back end had to be removed.
 (Again, there is no free lunch.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I believe the following are reasonable conclusions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If one intends to export as HTML, then markdown is, 
\emph on
by far
\emph default
, the most reasonable choice for a front end.
 Markdown was developed, first and foremost, as a simpler way to generate
 Web pages.
 There are special features in the HTML back end that can only be exploited
 in markdown documents.
 There are always some proponents of LaTeX that would have us convert to
 HTML, but none of the suggested avenues preserve equations and tables (in
 my experience) as well as markdown to HTML conversion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If one intends to export to PDF, then either markdown or LaTeX can be useful.
 But  LaTeX  is probably better.
  LaTeX  is primarily intended for the creation of publication-quality documents
 in PDF format.
 While it is true that markdown documents can benefit from insertion of
 LaTeX equations and some structures, they lack the ability to exploit many
 of the strengths in LaTeX document preparation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another concern is that R markdown implies an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra step
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the compilation process.
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rmd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is knitted into 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.md
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which then must be converted to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

, from which PDF is created.
 In contrast, a document prepared in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 format will be converted straight to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra step
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of translation (from 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.md
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

) is avoided in LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact of life, at least at the current time, is that it is not painless
 to change the output format without making wholesale changes in the document
 front end.
 If one writes a markdown document, using special features intended for
 the back end, then it is generally not possible to, at the last minute,
 change the output format.
 HTML output has advantages in Web style features, while PDF documents have
 advantages in "on paper" presentations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Where does my editor fit into this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need an editor that allows the insertion of code chunks and has the ability
 to compile documents (recall Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Compiling"

\end_inset

).
 Microsoft Word is not a workable alternative.
 One must either use a general purpose programmer's file editor and then
 compile the document using the R functions or command line scripts outlined
 above, or one may use an integrated development environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I recommend LyX (http://www.lyx.org) to many LaTeX learners.
 It is a graphical interface for preparation of LaTeX documents.
 LyX can export LaTeX files and it offers some good tools to learn about
 how to write LaTeX.
 LyX was used to create the skeletons provided with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
stationery
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We prepare the documents as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files, and then export to an equivalent 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX offers many benefits, but it has one limitation (which all LaTeX editors
 will share).
 LyX allows us to enter code chunks in the document, but it does not offer
 a convenient way to test chunks interactively.
 Rather, one must compile the whole document.
 I recommend running LyX from a terminal so that the R error messages will
 be easy to review, but that is only a modicum of relief.
 If one is editing in LyX (or in a LaTeX editor) and saves a file, the shell
 script rnw2pdf.sh will be able to compile the file.
 It will execute a sequence of steps roughly as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ lyx -e sweave stationery.lyx # creates a Rnw file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ R CMD Sweave stationery.Rnw # creates a tex file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ texi2pdf stationery.tex # creates pdf, could use pdflatex
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this succeeds, the result is fine, but when it fails, finding errors
 can be difficult.
 Compiling the LaTeX or LyX document has an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all or nothing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 feel.
 One can edit an 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file in any editor intended for LaTeX, of course, but those editors will
 have the same limitation that one cannot test R code chunks interactively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an alternative workflow, one can instead edit the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rmd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files with editors have an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inferior mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that can start an interactive R session.
 The author can create a code chunk and test it interactively before trying
 to compile the whole document.
 There are several editors that have that ability.
 The venerable editor Emacs (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://emacs.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

) offers Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS; 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://ess.r-project.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

) which is popular with experts for a number of reasons.
 Perceiving Emacs to be difficult to use, many novices enjoy RStudio, which
 has the ability to work with markdown or LaTeX files.
 Neither Emacs nor RStudio make the creation of LaTeX markup especially
 easy, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While working on the markdown documents in this package, we are struck by
 the fact that markdown is a movement, a 
\emph on
frame of mind
\emph default
, rather than a product.
 It is a rapidly moving target with several competing sets of idioms.
 Features are added and changed on a weekly basis.
 That is to say, we are on the steeply sloped curve of technical innovation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I extend an apology and salute to users of Emacs Org mode, which is an entirely
 different implementation of the same ideas as markdown (Org existed first).
 Org mode has a document header that is very similar to markdown, and it
 also has code chunks.
 We used Org mode to prepare a series of tutorials about Mplus programming
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://gitlab.crmda.ku.edu/crmda/semexample
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the editing process is rather similar to markdown.
 The main reason that I do not emphasize it in this context is that the
 number of Emacs Org mode users is quite small compared to either LaTeX
 or markdown at the current time.
 The development effort on Org mode is unpredictable.
 It is much more difficult to find accurate information about how to customize
 output from Org mode files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Should one prefer Sweave or knitr?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In R markdown, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
knitr
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the only available method to process code chunks.
 There is no Sweave chunk engine for markdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For LaTeX documents, we have the choice between the traditional 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Sweave
\end_layout

\end_inset

 chunk framework or the newer 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 framework.
 The syntax can be very similar, but 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
knitr
\end_layout

\end_inset

 introduced a more fine-grained set of options for the chunks (see

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One benefit of R markdown with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
knitr
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is that it is possible to make reproducible documents about other programming
 languages.
 I've explored markdown with knitr to weave documents about BASH shell programmi
ng, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major reason why I resist 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
knitr
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is that the format of the output is very difficult to control.
 Over the years, I have used the Listings class in LaTeX with Sweave to
 customize the appearance of code input and output.
 So far, at least, I've not had success customizing the output from 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
stationery
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package is a snapshot survey of what is practical, here and now, for the
 preparation of reproducible research reports.
 It seems likely that both LaTeX and R markdown documents will continue
 to exist (and compete for user loyalty) into the indefinite future.
 Neither of these authoring frameworks is without flaws, but each is workable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some authors who take an extreme position that an entire research
 project, all phases in the analysis of data, should be wrapped together
 into a single document.
 At the current time, there are practical problems that prevent us from
 achieving this goal with perfect fidelity.
 While the software to render regression tables has improved during the
 past 10 years, none of the available programs will offer a perfectly finalized
 presentation for all kinds of models.
 Rather, it appears we do need to leave room for some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hand editing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of tables that are exported from R.
 In the production graphs for figures we are considerably closer to the
 perfectly presentable standard, of course, and tables may approach that
 standard at some point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transition to a reproducible document framework will present challenges
 for new users.
 Authors who have used LaTeX, or written with LyX, will find this more familiar.
 For those authors, it will be relatively easy to learn to insert code chunks
 and re-think the document compilation process.
 For authors that do not have LaTeX background, it seems certain that the
 LyX versions of the rnw2pdf templates, or perhaps the R markdown formats,
 will be more appealing than raw LaTeX.
 It is easier to produce a rudimentary document from scratch with R markdown,
 but using the skeletons we provide, it seems that all of these documents
 should be equally convenient.
 General opinion among the younger crowd on the Internet seems to more enthusias
tically endorse R markdown, while the more experienced (dare I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

traditional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?) crowd prefers LaTeX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is perhaps not honest to predict that new users will find any of this
 to be easy or as convenient as a word processor.
 It is more likely to be correct and reproducible, but it is not easy.
 One can expect that authors, whether they start with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rnw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.Rmd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files, will hit bugs as they add features which seem natural and obvious.
 LaTeX equations, for example, can be included in either document format,
 but preparing them correctly is not easy.
 Features that work well in one format are either unavailable or more difficult
 in the other.
 While there are many Websites touting examples of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elegant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 documents, it seems certain that new visitors to the reproducible documents
 will find bugs where the experts never dreamed them to venture.
 Experts know what won't work, but they don't usually emphasize the difficulties
 as much as the victories.
 Although the markdown community has many eager, outspoken proponents, I
 have to admit that every markdown project on which I've worked hit one
 or more deep, unsolvable bugs that required re-engineering of a presentation.
 One source of change/trouble is 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
pandoc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 itself, which is evolving so rapidly that software distributors cannot
 keep up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One issue that users should be aware of is that the compiler tool chains
 are generally fragile.
 Slight changes that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seem safe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can cause compilation failures with vague error messages.
 This is partly due to the fact that the LaTeX compiler has its own layer
 of difficult-to-understand errors.
 Also, the process of Sweaving/knitting will stumble on errors in R code
 and sometimes the weaved output file will cause errors in the LaTeX compiler.
 The LyX authoring environment offers a very convenient way to rapidly move
 up the LaTeX learning curve; some difficulties can be avoided.
 However, LyX does not have a convenient way to test code interactively,
 which makes the R work more frustrating.
 On the other hand, an authoring environment that allows one to interact
 with R more directly, such as Emacs or RStudio, places the LaTeX learning
 curve as an obstacle at the outset.
